# Announcing a new release for 2020-06-09

So, this is about time this thing gets new paint applied.
After I almost abandoned this, I got a lot of questions when and how a new release of this "beauty" will be done.

So finally, during May, I will rewrite EvlWatcher. I can't promise that all of the features will be in it, but the plan is that the following things be implemented to it during the course of this remake:

- Fix some security issues with the configuration app. 

- Add a Repo description (i.e. a cool documentation an what not), and add community guidelines, to finally make it easier for others to contribute. 

- Do some necessary SE-stuff, like refactor it to SOLID, unit testing, etc.

- Do some maintenance like shifting it up to .Net Version 4.7.2, which is now default for Windows Servers

- Divide Tasks into "Actions" and "Triggers", so that Tasks can be combined better, (i.e. Ban + Telegram notification, etc..)

- And finally, revamp the configuration App and the Installer.

# Testers needed

Since I personally no longer expose my Windows Servers to the Web, I would also need testers to try out certain things.
If you wanna test that thing, please contact me.
